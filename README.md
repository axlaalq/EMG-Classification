# EMG-Classification

For my thesis project, I developed a convolutional neural network (CNN) from scratch using libraries like Keras, Pandas, NumPy, Pillow, and Matplotlib. The goal was to classify electromyographic (EMG) signals collected from a large dataset of individuals of varying ages and genders performing 10 distinct hand movements. Each participant began in an initial position, transitioned to a secondary position, and returned to the first position within a 15-second timeframe. Electrodes placed on their arms recorded 3200 data points per experiment.

The model was trained to classify these EMG signals into their corresponding movements, utilizing gradient descent, backpropagation, and the Adam optimizer. Additionally, I employed Gaussian process regression to fine-tune the hyperparameters, enhancing the network's performance and achieving reliable classification results. This project demonstrates the integration of deep learning techniques to analyze complex bio-signals effectively.
